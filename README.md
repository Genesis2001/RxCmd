RxCmd
=====

RxCmd is a remote administration utility for Renegade-X (UDKGame) servers. It allows you to open connections to your Renegade-X server and administrate it with ease. At the moment, it's only capable of a few commands (addbots, killbots, and say); however, it's highly extensible. Others are free to add their own commands to the system and submit a pull-request to have their commands included.
